          <h2>SECTION 1: PURPOSE</h2>

          <p>
            The Customer acknowledges that he/it has checked the suitability of the
            Service to his/its needs and that he/it has received from Juno all the
            information and advice needed to enter into this agreement knowledgeably
            and willingly. The purpose of this Agreement is to define the legal,
            technical, and financial conditions of Juno’s agreement with the Customer.
            These General Terms and Conditions of Service, to which will be added,
            as applicable, specific terms and conditions and/or schedules proposed
            by Juno, shall be applicable, at the exclusion of all other terms and
            conditions, including the terms and conditions of the Customer, to all
            the Customer’s orders of Service from the Juno Sole Proprietor. The Juno
            services offered gratuitously are also governed by these General Terms
            and Conditions of Service.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 2: JUNO&apos;S OBLIGATIONS</h2>

          <p>
            Juno agrees to use all due care and due dispatch to provide a quality
            Service in compliance with professional standards and the state of the
            art. Juno only has an obligation of means.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 3: JUNO’S LIABILITY</h2>

          <p>
            Juno shall not be liable in the circumstances described below.: If
            the performance of this Agreement, or of any of Juno’s obligations under
            such Agreement, is barred, limited or disrupted due to a fire, an
            explosion, a failure in the transmission networks, the collapse of the
            facilities, an epidemic, an earthquake, a flood, a power failure, a war,
            an embargo, a statute, an injunction, a request or demand from a
            government, a strike, a boycott, a withdrawal of authorization from the
            telecommunications operator, or any other circumstances beyond Juno’s
            reasonable control (&quot;Force Majeure event&quot;), then Juno,
            subject to a prompt notice to the Customer, shall be relieved from
            performing his/its obligations within the limits of this inability
            to act, limitation or disruption, and the Customer shall be likewise
            relieved from performing his/its obligations to the extent that
            his/its obligations pertain to the performance of the obligations
            thus barred, limited or disrupted, subject to such Party thus
            affected using its best efforts to avoid or mitigate such failure to
            perform and to both Parties acting promptly once such causes cease
            to exist or are eliminated. The Party affected by a Force Majeure
            event shall keep the other Party informed on a regular basis via
            electronic mail regarding the prognosis of eliminating such Force
            Majeure event or of recovering from it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Should the effects of this Force Majeure last more than thirty (30) days,
            as of the date of notice regarding such event from one Party to the
            other, the Agreement may be terminated as a matter of right, at the
            request of one of the Parties, without any right to compensation for
            either of them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or Juno shall not be liable the Customer causes, for example:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a deterioration of the application;
            </li>
            <li>
              the misuse of the terminals by the Customer or his/its clientele, a
              fault, negligence, omission or failure on his/its part, or
              non-compliance with the advice given;
            </li>
            <li>
              the disclosure or illegal use of the password confidentially given to
              the Customer;
            </li>
            <li>
              fault, negligence or omission of a third party over whom Juno has no
              control or supervision power;
            </li>
            <li>
              a request for a temporary or permanent interruption of the Service
              from a competent administrative or judicial authority, or upon notice
              from a third party; or
            </li>
            <li>
              the total or partial destruction of information transmitted or stored
              resulting from errors directly or indirectly attributable to
              the Customer.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The Customer acknowledges that Juno authorizes other Service users to
            install their websites and servers in his/its facilities. Juno shall not
            be liable in any way whatsoever for damages, costs or losses incurred by
            the Customer (or by his/its own customers) and caused by another Service
            user’s act, material or failure to act, Juno’s liability in contract, in
            tort (including negligence) or by statute, or otherwise, to the Customer
            (or his/its own customers), concerning performance or non-performance,
            as applicable, of any obligation created under this Agreement, with
            regard to any claim, shall be limited and shall not, in the aggregate,
            exceed the total fees paid by the Customer to Juno under this Agreement
            in the three- (3-) month period immediately preceding the date on which
            the claim arose. In no event shall Juno be liable for any lost profits,
            or any special, indirect, consequential, incidental or punitive damages.
            Juno does not offer any backup for the hosted data. It is therefore the
            Customer’s responsibility to take all required steps in order to back up
            his/its data in the event of a loss or deterioration of such data for any
            reason whatsoever, including reasons not explicitly mentioned hereunder.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 4: CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES</h2>

          <p>
            The Customer agrees to use his/its power, authority and capabilities to
            enter into this Agreement and perform his/its obligations as provided
            hereunder. The Customer agrees to communicate to Juno his/its accurate
            and updated contact information upon the creation of the Customer
            Account and each time such information is modified. Juno reserves the
            right to request supporting documentation from the Customer to ensure
            the accuracy of their information. The Customer is solely and exclusively
            responsible for the passwords that are required in order to use the
            Service. Juno is not responsible for the illegal or fraudulent use of
            passwords made available to the Customer. The passwords provided are
            considered confidential. The Customer shall be solely liable, at the
            exclusion of Juno, in the event of any suspicion that the passwords
            provided have been disclosed, whether intentionally or not. The Customer
            alone shall bear all the consequences of a malfunction of the Service
            resulting from the use by his/its staff or by any other person to whom
            the Customer has provided his/its password(s). The Customer shall also
            bear all the consequences resulting from the loss of such password(s).
            The Customer hereby agrees to comply with all legal and regulatory
            requirements in force, and, more specifically, with those pertaining to
            software, files, freedom and intellectual property, as well as the
            rights of third parties. The Customer also agrees to take out all
            required insurance policies from a well known solvent insurer, in order
            to cover all damages attributable to the Customer in connection with
            this Agreement or the performance thereof. The Customer hereby fully
            accepts all legal obligations arising from the administration of their
            Services. Juno cannot be held liable or investigated in this respect for
            any reason, especially in the event of a violation of the laws or
            regulations applicable to the Customer&apos;s Services. Non-compliance by the
            Customer with the aforementioned points detailed in Juno’s Special
            Conditions, and especially with any activity likely to generate a civil
            and/or penal liability will give Juno the right to immediately disconnect
            and/or stop the Customer&apos;s Services without prior notice, and to
            immediately and lawfully terminate this Agreement, without prejudice to
            the right to all damages and interest that Juno may claim. The Customer
            undertakes to settle directly with a claimant, any sum demanded from
            Juno by such claimant. Moreover, the Customer undertakes to intervene at
            the request of Juno in any proceedings brought against Juno and shall
            indemnify and hold harmless Juno from any and all such third party
            claims. Consequently, the Customer undertakes to address any third party
            complaint and/or procedure, regardless of form, object or nature, that
            is brought against Juno and is related to the Customer&apos;s obligations
            under this Agreement. The Customer hereby agrees to inform Juno within
            48 hours of any changes in his/its situation, and within 24 hours, of
            any lost passwords. Whenever contacting Juno, the Customer agrees to
            clearly describe his/its request in compliance with the terms of use.
            When suspicious activity (SPAM, violation of copyright, Attack, Phishing,
            illegal content, DoS PortScan ...) is detected by Juno or reported by a
            third party, Juno may contact the Client by email (and optionally attach
            a copy of the complaint received). It is expected that the Client respond
            to the notification within the time limit (24, 48 or 72 hours depending
            on the nature of the case) to provide its comments and intentions.
            Failure to respond could result in the suspension / termination of service.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 5: TERM AND RENEWAL OF SERVICE</h2>

          <h3>5.1. Term</h3>

          <p>
            The Service agreement shall be signed for an indefinite term. Juno
            reserves the right to suspend the Service at any time. Juno shall, to
            the extent possible, notify in advance the Service users, through a
            message on the mailing list created in connection with the beta-test,
            on Juno’s website or forum, or by any other means Juno deems necessary.
          </p>

          <h3>5.2. Service Renewal</h3>

          <p>
            Juno may possibly not renew its Service at the end of the term. Juno
            shall make every effort to inform the Customer beforehand regarding this
            and shall delete all the data stored by the Customer on the Service. The
            Customer hereby agrees to recover all his/its data prior to the end of
            the Service term. Any non-payment or irregular payment, meaning
            incorrect or incomplete amounts in particular, or lacking the required
            references, or made by any method or procedure not accepted by Juno are
            not acceptable and will result in rejection by Juno of the registration
            or renewal request. Concerning renewals paid by cheque, it is up to the
            Customer to request the renewal with sufficient time for the cheque to
            be received and processed by Juno prior to expiration of the Service.
            Juno reminds the Customer that the processing of a payment by cheque may
            take more than 5 working days in some cases.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 6: TERMINATION, LIMITATION AND SUSPENSION OF SERVICE</h2>

          <p>
            Breach by the Customer of his/its obligations as defined hereunder,
            including all activities specifically barred while using Juno services
            and/or any content specifically barred when using Juno services, and/or
            likely to result in civil and/or criminal liability and/or likely to
            prejudice a third party’s rights, shall give rise to Juno’s right to
            immediately cut off the cable and/or interrupt the Customer’s services,
            without any prior demand, and to immediately terminate the Service, as
            of right, without prejudice to any other damages Juno may have a right to
            claim. At the end of the term of this Service, for any reason
            whatsoever, Juno shall entirely delete all the files on the Customer‘s
            Service. Juno reserves the right to restrict, limit or suspend its
            services without prior notice nor indemnity if it appears that the
            Customer uses the services provided for any activity which violates the
            terms and conditions of the Agreement with Juno or the Service objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service may also be restricted, limited or suspended when the
            specific terms and conditions applicable to a type of Service offered by
            Juno provide for such sanctions in the event of a breach. The
            restriction, limitation or suspension measures shall always be taken in
            accordance with the seriousness or recurrence of the breach(es), and
            shall be based on the nature of such breach(es). The Customer agrees in
            advance that Juno may restrict, limit or suspend the Service offered if
            Juno receives a notice in that regard from a competent administrative,
            arbitral or judicial authority, in compliance with the laws and
            regulations in force. Either Party may terminate the Agreement, as of
            right and without indemnity, in the case of a Force Majeure event lasting
            more than thirty (30) days. Juno reserves the right to interrupt the
            Customer’s Service if such Service endangers the maintenance of security
            or stability on Juno’s hosting platform. Juno shall, to the extent
            possible, give the Customer prior notice regarding such interruption.
            Juno reserves the right to interrupt the Service, as needed, for
            technical interventions designed to improve its operations, or for
            maintenance procedures.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 7: OPERATING CONDITIONS</h2>

          <p>
            The Customer hereby acknowledges that bandwidth fluctuations and problems
            with the access provider could cause a gap in the services provided by
            the Juno Corporation, which it would be unable to resolve. However, the
            Service shall be restricted, limited or suspended, as of right, by Juno:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>if it seems that the Customer is using the services provided for any activity whatsoever which is not in compliance with these General Terms and Conditions;</li>
            <li>in compliance with the applicable Specific Terms and Conditions;</li>
            <li>if Juno receives a notice in that regard from a competent administrative, arbitral or judicial authority, in compliance with the appropriate applicable laws, or from a third party;</li>
            <li>if the contact information in the Customer’s account seems to be false, inaccurate or out of date.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 8: CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH SERVICE</h2>

          <p>
            The Customer acknowledges that he/it has checked the suitability of the
            material and the Service to his/its needs and has received from Juno all
            the information and advice needed to knowingly enter into this
            agreement. Juno reserves the right to monitor compliance with the
            Service’s terms of use.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 9: TOLERANCE</h2>

          <p>
            The fact that Juno fails to invoke one of the General Terms and
            Conditions of Service and/or tolerates the violation by the other Party
            of any of the obligations hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver
            to invoke in the future any of these Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>SECTION 10: PERSONAL DATA</h2>

          <p>
            Juno reminds the Customer that, while providing the Service to the
            Customer, Juno may keep some of the Customer’s personal data in
            compliance with its regulatory and judicial obligations. Information
            such as “last name, first name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone
            numbers, and IP connection addresses” shall be kept by Juno during the
            entire term of the Agreement and up to twelve (12) months after the
            expiration of the Service. The data transmitted by the Customer shall

            otherwise provided in the Specific Terms and Conditions, Juno shall not

            his/its personal data may be stored, handled and transferred by Juno to
            its affiliates, who shall only have access to such data in order to
            perform essential functions in the provision of the Service, all in
            strict compliance with the Customer’s privacy rights. The Customer also

          <h2>SECTION 11: AMENDMENTS</h2>

          <p>
            The General and Specific Terms and Conditions online take precedence
            over the printed General and Specific Terms and Conditions. The parties
            agree that Juno may, as of right, bring changes to its Service simply by
            informing the Customer through an online notice and/or by amending its
            General Terms and Conditions online. Any amendment or introduction of
            new options offered shall be posted online on the Juno Site or sent via
            e-mail to the Customer. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6, the
            Customer shall then have the right to terminate the Agreement within
            thirty (30) days of the effective date of such amendments.

          <p>
            The invalidity of one of the provision of the Service Agreement entered

            remain in full force and effect. The Parties shall, in such cases, to
            the extent possible, replace the invalid provision with a valid
            provision consistent with the spirit and object of the Agreement’s terms
            and conditions.

            shall be kept by Juno during the entire term of the contractual
            relationship between the Parties. All notices, communications, and
            demands provided under the General Terms and Conditions shall be deemed
            to have been validly delivered if they are sent by registered mail,

            indicate the services provided to the Customer, on its commercial
            documents and/or in its annual report.
